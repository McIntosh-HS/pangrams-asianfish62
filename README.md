# Pangram
A pangram, or holoalphabetic sentence, is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. Pangrams have been used to display typefaces, test equipment, and develop skills in handwriting, calligraphy, and keyboarding.

The best-known English pangram is “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”. 
Others include:
Jived fox nymph grabs quick waltz
Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump
The five boxing wizards jump quickly
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs

A perfect pangram contains every letter of the alphabet only once and is considered an anagram of the alphabet. “Mr Jock, TV quiz PhD, bags few lynx”.

Write a program that will determine if a sentence is a pangram. **To test your computational thinking ability, you are NOT allowed to use lists.**
